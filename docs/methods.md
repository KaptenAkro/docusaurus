### How are the interests calculated?

Interest rates are determined algorithmically (based on supply and demand), and interest accrues every Ethereum block. Interest is calculated in real-time based on supply and demand. When liquidity is plentiful, interest rates are low. As liquidity becomes scarce, interest rates increase, incentivizing new supply and the repayment of borrowing.
